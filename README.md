# XFCE Dot Files

## Welcome to my XFCE4 Dot Files
Below you will find a list of applications that will need to be installed prior to setting up the dot files.
None of these are required unless you want an exact copy of my setup.

```
Brave Web Browser
Kitty
Picom
Spicetify (and Spotify)
Thunar
Discord
Vencord
ZSH
```

Below are also helpful links for setting up the theme.
If I forgot any, I will upload the link here.
